ðŸ“Š Student Performance Analysis
This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook for analyzing student performance data. It includes data preprocessing, visualization, and statistical analysis to identify key factors affecting student success. The notebook may use machine learning models to predict performance based on various features.

Features:
Data cleaning and preprocessing
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) with visualizations
Statistical insights and correlations
Machine learning models for performance prediction (if applicable)
ðŸš€ Getting Started: Clone the repo, install dependencies, and run the notebook.

If the notebook has specific features (like a focus on certain datasets, ML models, or unique metrics), let me know so I can refine the description! ðŸš€
